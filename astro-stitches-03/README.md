# Astro + Stitches 3

Exploring using [Stitches](https://stitches.dev/) in [Astro](https://astro.build/). Based off the default Astro starter.

```bash
# or npm
yarn dev
yarn build
yarn preview
```

## Objective

Try to replicate https://codesandbox.io/s/github/jonathantneal/astro-stitches

After multiple attempts and failures to install `@astro/stitches` from `https://pkg.csb.dev/modulz/stitches/commit/86f7072f/@stitches/astro`, I decided to copy the code manually from https://github.com/modulz/stitches/tree/86f7072f3e0f06720d7587faa846304b2c2b6d40/packages/astro/src

Halfway through I realised this would require porting half the `@stitches/core` library and decided not to pursue it further.

I include this in the repo for comparison but by all means ignore this directory.
